A machine-readable description of the hardware
	–Passed to the kernel at boot time
	–Same kernel can run on different machines
	-Any differences in the hardware are captured in the device tree.
	
	Two forms of file:
		–*.dts – Human-readable.
		–*.dtb – “Binary blob” passed to kernel @ boot.
		
	Device tree compiler DTC converts dts <-> dtb.
	
Shows up in /proc on running kernel.

DEVICE TREE
- nodes bounded by {}
- attributes inside nodes
- 'compatible' attr specifies driver
- 'reg' attr specifies memory-mapped address ranges
